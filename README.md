# 🚀 New Project Launch: Retail Business Performance & Profitability Analysis App 🎉

I’m excited to share a Streamlit-based web app I’ve developed that enables retailers, analysts, and small business owners to quickly analyze their business performance using just a CSV or Excel file!

This app provides a streamlined way to analyze retail data and uncover insights such as:

📈 Total Sales, Total Profit, and Average Profit Margin

🔍 Interactive Sales Forecast using Prophet for the next 3 months

📊 Visual Profit and Margin Trends over time

📥 Upload your retail data and let the app do the rest!

📂 Just upload a CSV or Excel file containing:

A Date column

A Sales column

(Optional) A Profit column (if missing, it assumes 20% profit margin)
